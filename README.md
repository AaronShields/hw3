This is my README.md file

For parts 1/2/3
I edited the .h file, and added the implimentation of llfilter in there as well. 

To run it, type make, and add the executables afterwards

For heaps: 
type make test in heap directory to run heap tests 
should pass all 20 tests
finally, type make valgrind and should pass tests


For parts concering the input + output pngs: 
You may have to make clean to recompile pictures
But type make and run specified commands, and the pictures are loaded.
